# Usage
#
#   ./releasing/localbuild.sh
#
# The script attempts to use cloudbuild configuration
# to create a release "locally".
#
# See https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/build-debug-locally
#
# At the time of writing,
#
#   https://pantheon.corp.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=kustomize-199618
#
# has a trigger such that whenever a git tag is
# applied to the kustomize repo, the cloud builder
# reads the repository-relative file
#
#   releasing/cloudbuild.yaml
#  
# Inside this yaml file is a reference to the script
#
#   releasing/cloudbuild.sh
#
# The script you are reading now does something
# analogous via docker tricks.
